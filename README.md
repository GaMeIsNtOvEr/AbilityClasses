Thanks for using AbilityClasses
This plugin is made for custom classes with their own abilities which is really cool.
I've tried to make a great api for making classes & abilities very easy but don't worry i'll describe everything you may need but first.
if you want to use the plugin api you should just do this in your pom.xml:

```xml

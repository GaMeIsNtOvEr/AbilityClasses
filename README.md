Thanks for using AbilityClasses
This plugin is made for custom classes with their own abilities which is really cool.
I've tried to make a great api for making classes & abilities very easy but don't worry i'll describe everything you may need but first.
if you want to use the plugin api you should just do this in your pom.xml:

```xml	
<repositories> 
		 <repository>
		    <id>jitpack.io</id>
	    <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
		 </repository>
 </repositories>
	
	
	<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.GaMeIsNtOvEr</groupId>
    <artifactId>AbilityClasses</artifactId>
    <version>34f169e7ee</version>
	</dependency>
 ```

You may also need adding 
```yml
depend:
  - AbilityClasses
```
to your code

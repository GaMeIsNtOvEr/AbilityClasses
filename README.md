Thanks for using AbilityClasses
This plugin is made for custom classes with their own abilities which is really cool.
if you want to use the plugin api you should just do this in your pom.xml:

```xml	
<repositories> 
		 <repository>
		    <id>jitpack.io</id>
	    <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
		 </repository>
 </repositories>
	
	
	<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.GaMeIsNtOvEr</groupId>
    <artifactId>AbilityClasses</artifactId>
    <version>-SNAPSHOT</version>
	</dependency>
 ```
Im still Working on the api so be patient
